# Rapid Response Toolkit

## Purpose

To make it easy for community justice organizers to spin up a website and provide potential supporters with context. Also can be used for mobilization purposes.

## How to use the template
1. Fork this repo.
2. The landing page is already created; feel free to add your own text or adjust
the styling/themes to fit your needs first.
3. Deploy your fork to Netlify (see next section) and name the url something that's easy to share.
Example: [searslanecommunity.netlify.app](searslanecommunity.netlify.app).
4. Every time you push to `main` be aware that the updates will show up almost
   instantly! This is a double-edged sword. Best way to test everything is to
   open `index.html` in your browser to check your work.

## Deploying to Netlify

1. Sign up for a Netlify account.
2. Connect your Github to Netlify.
3. Connect your website repo to Netlify.
4. Leave `Build command` and `Base directory` blank.
5. Set `Publish directory` to `/`.
6. Fire away, captain!
